# Project Euler with V

## Installation
### Step 1. Install V
Currently V is a very new platform and is best installed from source. This is accomplished quickly with the
following commands ...

```
git clone https://github.com/vlang/v
cd v
make
# HINT: Using Windows?: run make.bat in the cmd.exe shell
```

### Step 2. Symlink
On Linux systems, create a /usr/local/bin/v symlink to your executable. To do that, run:

```
sudo ./v symlink
```
